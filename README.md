## Introductory data science course in Python

A two-day, instructor-led, hands-on learning experience that takes you from the fundamentals of the Python language through to web-deployed machine learning assets. With a focus on the Python essentials for data science, you will learn how to manipulate data, build models, view the results with interactive dashboards and explore the latest features of Microsoftâ€™s AzureML Python libraries. If you work with data and want to learn data science and Python, this is the course for you!
